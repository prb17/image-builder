# image-builder
Repo that creates a docker image that will build other docker images, as well as publish them.

This tool is meant to be normally run in a ci/cd workflow build for image-config repo, but other repos can use it as well

 ### Variables to set
  - `DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT` - location to build context
  - `DOCKER_BUILD_TAG` - what image-builder should tag the build with
  - `DOCKER_PUBLISH_REGISTRY` - where to publish the image
 
Example command:
```
 docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ${DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT}:${DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT} \
    -e DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT=${DOCKER_BUILD_CONTEXT} \
    -e DOCKER_BUILD_TAG=${DOCKER_BUILD_TAG} \
    -e DOCKER_PUBLISH_REGISTRY=my-reg \
    -it image-builder
 ```
